Below is a detailed guide to help you with this:\n\n### Leave Request Procedure:\n\n1. **Check Leave Balance:**\n   - Before submitting a leave request, verify your available leave balance. This can typically be done through the companyâ€™s HR portal or by contacting the HR department.\n\n2. **Submit a Formal Request:**\n   - Use the designated HR software or platform used by PrezLab to submit your leave request. This might include platforms like an HR portal or email, depending on the company's setup.\n   - Clearly state the date(s) you wish to take off and the type of leave (e.g., casual leave, annual leave, sick leave).\n\n3. **Provide Advance Notice:**\n   - It's advisable to give as much advance notice as possible. A minimum of two weeks for planned leaves is generally recommended to ensure workload adjustments can be made.\n\n4. **Notify Your Line Manager:**\n   - Inform your manager, Sanad Feras Khaleel Zaqtan, about your leave request. This can be done via email or a sit-down meeting, depending on their preference.\n   - Discuss any pending tasks or responsibilities and propose how your duties will be covered in your absence.\n\n5. **Await Approval:**\n   - The leave request needs approval from your manager and possibly the HR department. Follow up with them if you don't receive a response within a reasonable timeframe.\n\n6. **Adjust Work Schedules:**\n   - Once approved, adjust your work schedule or hand over responsibilities as necessary. Ensure that team members and relevant parties are aware of your absence.\n\n### Considerations:\n\n- **Emergencies or Short Notices:**\n  - In case of emergencies, inform your manager as soon as possible and submit a request immediately once you have access to the appropriate platform.\n\n- **Country-Specific Regulations:**\n  - Jordan: Be aware of local employee rights and labor laws regarding leave.\n  - UAE & KSA: Policies might vary slightly; ensure compliance with local laws if applicable.\n\n### Example Scenario:\n\n- **Scenario:** You plan to take a day off on November 15th.\n  - **Steps:** \n      1. Check your leave balance to ensure availability.\n      2. Submit a request for November 15th using the HR portal.\n      3. Email Sanad Feras Khaleel Zaqtan to notify and discuss task coverage.\n      4.
