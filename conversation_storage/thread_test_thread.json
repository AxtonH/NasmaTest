    "content": "Certainly! Here's a comprehensive breakdown of Prezlab's overtime policy as it applies to employees in Jordan, UAE, and KSA:\n\n### Categories of Overtime\n\n1. **Regular Workdays:**\n   - Overtime performed during regular workdays is subject to specific multipliers on the regular hourly wage. These multipliers are determined by the labor laws applicable in the respective country.\n\n2. **Holidays and Weekends:**\n   - Work done on official public holidays and weekends typically warrants a higher multiplier due to the nature of work during these periods. The exact multiplier can vary based on country-specific labor regulations.\n\n### Calculation of Overtime\n\n- **Jordan:**\n  - Overtime is calculated at a rate of 125% of the regular hourly wage for work performed beyond the standard working hours on regular days.\n  - For work performed on public holidays and weekends, the overtime rate increases to 150% of the regular hourly wage.\n\n- **United Arab Emirates (UAE):**\n  - Regular overtime work is remunerated at 125% of the regular wage.\n  - Overtime work during late night hours, which is often defined as after 9 PM, may attract an additional supplement as per UAE labor laws.\n  - On public holidays and weekends, overtime is compensated at 150%.\n\n- **Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA):**\n  - Normal overtime work during regular workdays is compensated at a rate of 150% of the regular hourly wage.\n  - For work on holidays and official days off, the rate increases to 200%.\n\n### Requests and Approvals\n\n1. **Overtime Requests:**\n   - Employees are required to inform their supervisors or department heads in advance when they foresee the need to work overtime.\n   - Formal requests should be submitted through the designated internal system or form well before the overtime is to be worked.\n\n2. **Approval Workflow:**\n   - All overtime requests must be approved by the employee's line manager or department head. This ensures that overtime is justified and necessary.\n   - Approved requests are forwarded to the HR department for final confirmation and processing within the payroll system.\n\n### Compliance and Documentation\n\n- All overtime work must comply with the national labor regulations of the respective countries. This ensures not only adherence to legal requirements but also fair compensation for employees.\n- Comprehensive records of overtime hours worked and approvals must be maintained by both the department and HR for auditing and tracking purposes.\n\nBy following these guidelines, Prezlab ensures transparency and fairness in the compensation process for overtime work, while also respecting the labor laws of each country. Always consult the latest policy documents or contact HR for any updates or specific inquiries related to your situation."
