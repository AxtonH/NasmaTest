Here’s a detailed guide on how to proceed with your time-off request:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process for Requesting Time Off\n\n1. **Determine Leave Type**:\n   - Identify the type of leave you wish to take. Prezlab offers various types per its policy, including annual leave, sick leave, and other special leaves.\n   - If your leave type is marked as \"Prez,\" this is additional to those mandated by local labor laws.\n\n2. **Check Leave Entitlement**:\n   - Verify your available leave balance to ensure you have sufficient days left for the requested period.\n   - In Jordan, sick leave payment is divided between full and partial pay based on the duration, while in the UAE and KSA, different allocations apply depending on the length of sick leave.\n   - For part-time employees, annual leave is calculated based on hours worked.\n\n3. **Application Process**:\n   - Fill out the official leave request form available on the company’s internal portal or through HR.\n   - Specify the type, start date, and end date of your leave.\n   - Provide any additional required documentation, especially for sick leave (e.g., medical certificates) or special leave requests (study or pilgrimage leave may require additional documentation).\n\n4. **Submit to Line Manager**:\n   - Submit your request to your direct line manager for initial approval. They will review and provide feedback or approval.\n   - For special leaves, additional documentation and processing time may be required for approval.\n\n5. **HR Approval**:\n   - Once approved by your line manager, the request is forwarded to HR for final approval and record-keeping. \n   - HR will check against policy compliance related to leave types specific to each country.\n\n6. **Confirmation**:\n   - After HR approval, you will receive a confirmation of your leave via email or through the HR system.\n   - Ensure you receive confirmation before taking leave to avoid misunderstandings or discrepancies.\n\n### Important Considerations:\n\n- **Annual Leave Carry-Over**: Check if any leave days need to be taken by a certain date to avoid losing them due to policy on year-end carry-over limits.\n\n- **Country-Specific Regulations**: Be aware that leave entitlements can differ based on local labor laws and the country you are based in (Jordan, UAE, KSA).\n\n- **Advance Notice**: It’s advisable to submit your leave request well in advance, especially for longer durations, to accommodate workflow planning and to ensure leave approval.\n\nIf you need assistance with the leave request form or further guidance on your specific situation, please reach out to the HR department or consult your line manager."
